# Flite Engine
The FliteEngine is Objective-C static library project containing light wrapper for [Flite](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/) open source speech synthesizer.

It does not add any new features to Flite, it only exposes its funcionality as Objective-C class methods and combines this functionality with iOS _AVFoundation Framework_
