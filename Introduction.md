# Introduction #

A few years ago I was looking for some Objective-C framework which would allow to speech text on iOS devices in our project. In that time i did not find any, but only tree plain speech synth libraries written i C - [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net), [Flite](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/) and [Festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/).
After couple days of research and attempts to integrate those libraries for iOS SDK I choosed eSpeak and Flite as candidates (I was able to successfully customize only eSpeak and Flite in reasonable time, they supports more languages, Google use eSpeek for its translation serviceâ€¦).

In next couple of lines is described Flite speech synthesizer wrapper - FliteEngine.


# Details #

The _FliteEngine_ is Objectice-C static library project containing very light wrapper for Flite open source speech synthesizer (based on release version 1.4). It does not add any new features to Flite, it only exposes a part of its funcionality as Objective-C class methods and combines this functionality with iOS _AVFoundation Framework_ (to see all available properties of Flite synthesizer, please read documentation on its homepage url). It also uses standard delegate pattern by defining _FliteEngineDelegate_.
In static library project also exists a test target which contains simple iPhone app. This sample app has only a one screen with the UITextView for text input and the UIButton to start speech syntesis of an entered text.

# Usage #
Usage of the FliteEngine is very easy, You have to only add a standard dependency on the FliteEngine static library project to Your project and add path to folder _Flite\_1\_0/Classes_ in _Target Build Settings: Header Search Paths_

Then import the _FliteEngine_ header in class which is holding engine instance:

```
#import "FliteEngine.h"
```

In the init or the viewDidLoad method create a new instance of the _FliteEngine_ and set all parameters you want (speed, variance, pitch):

```
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    engine = [[FliteEngine alloc] init];
    engine.volume = 1;
} 
```

And finally bind any button's touch event to code which calls the _FliteEngine_ a speak method:

```
- (IBAction)speech {
    NSString * text = self.textView.text;
    [engine speak:text];
}
```

No documentation is included in this up-to-date version. Anyhow, the source code is self-explanatory and has altogether only a few hundred lines, also test application is good start point to look for more properties.

Any questions will be answered, feel free to contact me.
